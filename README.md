# hPSMC
Tools for F1 hybrid PSMC (hPSMC) divergence time inference from whole genomes


1) Create an hPSMC .psmcfa input file from two samples 
	haploidize each bam file to a fasta
	
2) run psmc using the hPSMC.psmcfa
3) Visualize hPSMC.psmc and estimate pre-diverence population size.
4) Run simulations of divergence without post-divergence migration to compare to the hPSMC plot
5) Plot simulations with the orignal data to show the divergence between samples.
